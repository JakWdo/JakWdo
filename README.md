Hi there üëã I'm Jakub Wdowicz

Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI technology and its applications in psychology and social impact. 
With a strong foundation in both technical implementation and research methodology, I specialize in developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and human behavior.

üî≠ Current Focus

I'm currently working on my Master's thesis investigating cultural and linguistic biases in state-of-the-art Language Models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAIs GPTs. 
This research aims to understand how these models handle cultural nuances and emotional expression across different societies.
